# Sales Tracker

This is a beginner â€“ level Python project tracking sales and summarizing results.

The script does the following:
- Prompts the user to enter their name, age, and city.
- Accepts a list of sales amounts as input.
- Identifies and prints all high sales (above 200).
- Calculates and displays the average sale amount.
- Shows a summary: total number of sales and number of high sales.
- Prints all sales with their index positions using a for loop and range().
