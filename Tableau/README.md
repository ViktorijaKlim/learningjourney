# Tableau project
Project description: Dashboard and presentation for Executive Leadership and Sales Team
In this project, I used Tableau to analyze sales data from the AdventureWorks dataset and highlighted important trends. The results show that sales are growing every year, shipping is usually early and online sales have a potential to grow. Returning customers spend more than new ones and bikes are the best-selling products. I also identified the top 10 customers and best-performing salespeople who deserve recognition. The USA leads in total sales, however other countries also show a potential. This project gives a clear view of a performance and shows opportunities.
Product data was pulled from Big Query.
I also created presentations for two different teams.
