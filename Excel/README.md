# Excel project â€“ AdwentureWorks overview

In this project, I analyzed AdventureWorks sales data in Excel to deliver key business insights on the Overview sheet. Using a structured approach, I explored monthly sales trends, compared online vs. offline orders, assessed delivery performance and identified top-performing salespeople, countries and sales reasons. 
I used pivot tables, charts, INDEX-MATCH, conditional formatting visualize the data effectively. After each section I gave my insights and recommendations.
